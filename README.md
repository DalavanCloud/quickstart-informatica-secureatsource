## Informatica Secure@Source on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys Informatica Secure@Source on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

Informatica Secure@Source provides global visibility of sensitive data assets, actionable insights into sensitive data risks, timely detection of insider and outsider threats, and accurate identification of high risk conditions; supporting data security, compliance, and governance.

The Quick Start provisions a single-node or multi-node, configurable, embedded cluster for the Informatica domain and Secure@Source in your AWS account. It deploys Informatica components for extracting, storing, and analyzing metadata, capturing and processing user activity and behavior analytics, data integration, cataloging, administration, and similar services.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying Secure@Source into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) that's configured for security, scalability, and high availability
- Deploying Secure@Source into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
